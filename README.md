# Image-Classification

Following notebook uses a combination of convolutional neural networks(VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50) and clustering algorithms(K-means, Gaussian Mixture Model) for unsupervised image classification. Flower images are used for the classification. F1 score is used for evaluation of the model.

## The following algorithms were used:
● OpenCV: Image reading and resizing.<br>
● SciKit-Learn: Data shuffling, Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture clustering, Principal
Component Analysis, and performance metrics.<br>
● Keras wth tensorflow backend: VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet50 convolution network
models with ImageNet weights.<br>
